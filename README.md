# 4channer
An unofficial 4chan read-only client for iPhone and iPad, using the [4chan read-only JSON API](https://github.com/4chan/4chan-API).

### Features
- Native SwiftUI interface
- Add boards as favorites!
- Save images and share posts
- Other features coming soon :3

### Why?
Because I wanted to try SwiftUI and stuff, and because I thought an iOS app could be nice.  
Therefore I'm sorry if the code is shit because it's the first time I'm trying.
